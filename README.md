# The-Gaming-Room-Client
The Gaming Room was the client for this project, and their goal was to expand their Android-based game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based application that could run across multiple platforms. The game required support for multiple teams and players, synchronized gameplay, and the ability to scale in a distributed environment. My role was to design the software architecture and evaluate operating platforms to ensure the application could meet these requirements while remaining efficient and user-friendly.

One aspect I did particularly well was the evaluation of operating platforms. I provided a clear analysis of Linux, Windows, macOS, and mobile devices, highlighting their advantages, weaknesses, and licensing costs. This gave the client a strong foundation for making informed decisions about deployment. I also organized the documentation into logical sections, which made the design easy to follow and professional in presentation.

Working through the design document was especially helpful because it required me to think holistically about the system before writing any code. By identifying requirements, constraints, and architectural considerations early, I was able to anticipate challenges such as memory management, distributed communication, and cross-platform compatibility. This planning process streamlined development and reduced the risk of overlooking critical functionality.

If I were to revise one part of my work, I would improve the domain model section by adding more detailed UML diagrams and examples of class interactions during gameplay. This would make the design more visual and accessible to stakeholders. I would also expand on scalability strategies, such as containerization and load balancing, to demonstrate how the system could handle thousands of concurrent users.

Interpreting the user’s needs was central to the design. The client wanted a multi-platform solution, so I focused on responsive HTML5 interfaces, browser compatibility, and server technologies that could scale. Considering user needs is critical because the success of the application depends on delivering a seamless experience across devices. Ignoring these needs would result in poor adoption and user frustration.

My approach to software design relied on object-oriented principles, modular architecture, and distributed system strategies. I used techniques such as the singleton pattern for game management, inheritance for shared attributes, and WebSockets for real-time communication. In the future, I would continue to use structured design documents, UML modeling, and iterative development. I would also incorporate user testing and feedback loops earlier in the design phase to ensure the software aligns closely with user expectations.

In summary, this project emphasized the importance of thorough planning, clear documentation, and user-centered design. By carefully analyzing platforms, anticipating technical challenges, and prioritizing user needs, I was able to create a design that prepares Draw It or Lose It for successful expansion into a distributed, multi-platform environment.
